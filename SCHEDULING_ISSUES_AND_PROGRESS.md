# Scheduling System - Current Issues & Progress Documentation

## ðŸ“‹ **System Overview**
The scheduling system consists of 6 main components that handle tutorial session creation, doctor notifications, availability tracking, and timetable management.

---

## ðŸ”§ **Current UI/UX Issues**

### **1. Doctor Session Booking (DoctorSessionBooking.js:1-440)**
- **Missing responsive design** - Fixed widths may break on mobile devices
- **Inconsistent spacing** - Mixed inline styles and CSS classes create visual inconsistency
- **Poor error messaging** - Generic error messages don't provide specific guidance
- **Custom slot validation** - No real-time feedback for invalid time combinations
- **Loading states** - No loading indicators during API calls
- **Accessibility issues** - Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### **2. Scheduler Landing (SchedulerLanding.js:1-158)**
- **Card layout** - Cards could benefit from better visual hierarchy
- **Icon consistency** - Some cards use different icons for similar functions
- **Animation performance** - Heavy animations may impact performance on slower devices
- **Toast notifications** - Limited customization and positioning options

### **3. Doctor Scheduler Main Page (DoctorScheduler-MainPage.js:1-947)**
- **Complex modal system** - Multiple overlapping modals create confusing user flow
- **Dense notification cards** - Information overload in notification displays
- **Poor mobile experience** - Modal positioning and sizing issues on small screens
- **Inconsistent button styles** - Mixed button designs across different actions
- **Confusing state management** - Users may lose track of current selection state
- **Performance issues** - Frequent polling (every 5 seconds) may impact performance
- **Error handling** - Limited error recovery options for failed operations

### **4. Create New Session (CreateNewSession.js:1-820)**
- **Form complexity** - Overwhelming number of fields and options
- **Filter performance** - Real-time filtering may lag with large datasets
- **Email preview layout** - Poor formatting and limited customization
- **Selection feedback** - Unclear visual feedback for selected items
- **Authentication flow** - Complex authentication process with poor user guidance
- **Validation feedback** - Delayed validation messages and poor error positioning

### **5. Email Monitoring (EmailMonitoring.js:1-353)**
- **Configuration errors** - Poor error messaging for configuration issues
- **Limited monitoring feedback** - Basic status indicators without detailed information
- **Authentication complexity** - Confusing multi-step authentication process
- **Log display** - Poor formatting and limited filtering options
- **Real-time updates** - Aggressive polling may cause performance issues

### **6. Doctor Scheduling Calendar (DoctorScheduling.js:1-1442)**
- **Calendar performance** - Heavy operations during export and view changes
- **Complex modals** - Overwhelming edit modal with too many options
- **Export process** - Confusing multi-step export with poor progress feedback
- **Undo/Redo visibility** - Limited visual feedback for action history
- **Drag-and-drop feedback** - Poor visual feedback during event manipulation
- **Time validation** - Inconsistent time format handling across components

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recent Fixes & Improvements**

### **December 2024 - Change Request Conflict Detection**
- **Issue**: Change requests could be approved even when they created scheduling conflicts for the same doctor
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive conflict detection logic in `DoctorScheduler-MainPage.js:411-446`
- **Behavior**: When a doctor requests to reschedule to a time that conflicts with their existing sessions:
  - System checks all existing sessions for the same doctor
  - Compares time ranges using overlap detection (new_start < existing_end AND new_end > existing_start)
  - Shows detailed conflict alert with existing session information
  - Prevents the update and closes the modal
  - Suggests choosing a different time or rescheduling the existing session first
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Uses `parseDateAndTime()` helper function for consistent time parsing
  - Handles various time formats (12-hour with AM/PM, time ranges with different separators)
  - Excludes the session being updated from conflict checking
  - Case-insensitive doctor name matching

### **December 2024 - Doctor Full Timetable View**
- **Issue**: Doctors could only see their own sessions, limiting their ability to coordinate with other doctors
- **Fix**: Modified `StaffTimetable.js` to show all sessions while maintaining edit permissions
- **Features**:
  - **Full visibility**: Doctors can now see all sessions from all doctors
  - **Edit restrictions**: Doctors can only edit sessions assigned to them
  - **Visual distinction**: 
    - Own sessions: Blue color with full opacity and solid border (editable)
    - Other doctors' sessions: Gray color with reduced opacity and dashed border (read-only)
    - Rescheduled sessions: Orange color for changed sessions
    - Pending requests: Orange color for sessions with pending change requests
  - **Clear feedback**: 
    - Shows doctor name on other doctors' sessions
    - Different cursor styles (pointer for editable, default for read-only)
    - Alert message when trying to edit others' sessions: "This session belongs to Dr. [Name]. You can only edit sessions assigned to you."
  - **Visual legend**: Color-coded legend above calendar explaining the different session types
- **Technical Details**:
  - Removed filtering logic that limited sessions to current user
  - Added `isOwnSession` flag to events for permission checking
  - Enhanced `eventStyleGetter` with conditional styling
  - Updated `CustomEvent` component to show doctor names for other doctors' sessions

- **Excessive re-renders** during calendar operations and filtering
- **Large data handling** inefficiencies with student/doctor lists
- **Unoptimized API calls** with frequent unnecessary requests

### **Code Quality Issues**
- **Mixed styling approaches** (inline styles + CSS classes)
- **Inconsistent error handling** across components
- **Complex state management** with deeply nested objects
- **Lack of TypeScript** for better type safety
- **Missing unit tests** for critical functionality

### **Security Concerns**
- **Client-side email authentication** tokens stored in localStorage
- **Limited input validation** on form submissions
- **Missing CSRF protection** on API endpoints
- **Inadequate error logging** for security monitoring

### **Accessibility Issues**
- **Missing ARIA labels** on interactive elements
- **Poor keyboard navigation** support
